# Hello world...

This will, what I hope to be, the beginning of my self-taught blog development journey. My intention is: 

- To successfully develop a website where I can blog and journal regularly
- To upload content to the blog in order to showcase some of my recent thoughts and academic work.
- Use this project as a means to build a portfolio

**I am a student studying English and Philosophy -- I know nothing about code.**

I am debating between Sublime and VSCode as my main editor.
